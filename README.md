# ExpressJSNoteTaker

The name of the application is ExpressJSNoteTaker

The application is a note taking app where the front end was provided and I wrote the code in the files server.js, notes.js, clog.js, fsUtils.js, uuid.js to connect the front end to the back end and deployed the app on Heroku.

## Mockup

The following .gifs shows the application's appearance and functionality on a desktop.

## Notes
Because I did not have the file structure set up correctly, I had to delete my initial repository so the final repository does not have as many commits as I usually have on projects.
